- **Health callouts**: "Low health" when below 25%
- **Phase transitions**: "Phase change incoming"
- **Positioning**: "Spread out" or "Group up" as needed
- **Target priority**: "Focus [target]" for coordination
- **Emergency**: "Retreat" or "Regroup" for dangerous situations

**Post-Fight Protocol**:
1. **Immediate safety**: Heal and secure area
2. **Loot distribution**: Discuss and divide rewards fairly
3. **Progress assessment**: Update group advancement status
4. **Next steps planning**: Decide immediate follow-up actions

### Exploration Coordination

**Cave Exploration Teams**:
- **2-person teams**: Safer for dangerous areas
- **Solo with check-ins**: Efficient for resource gathering
- **Full group**: New biomes or challenging areas

**Mapping Standards**:
- Mark important locations with consistent symbols
- Share coordinates for significant finds
- Create group waypoints for major landmarks
- Document dangerous areas and safe paths

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Player Death Management
**When teammate dies**:
1. **Immediate**: Continue current objective if safe
2. **Recovery**: Help retrieve items if in dangerous area
3. **Re-equipment**: Share backup gear from community storage
4. **Prevention**: Identify what went wrong and adjust strategy

### Progress Desynchronization
**When players fall behind**:
- **Catch-up sessions**: Dedicated time to bring players up to speed
- **Gear sharing**: Provide appropriate equipment for current phase
- **Guided exploration**: Show efficient routes and techniques
- **Flexible pacing**: Adjust group progression speed as needed

### Resource Conflicts
**When multiple players need same item**:
1. **Priority assessment**: Who benefits most immediately?
2. **Alternative solutions**: Can substitute items work?
3. **Future planning**: When will similar items be available?
4. **Fair rotation**: Ensure everyone gets upgrades over time

# üéØ OPTIMIZATION TIPS & TRICKS

## Time-Saving Techniques

### Efficient Resource Gathering
**Mining Optimization**:
- **Spelunker Potions**: Mandatory for ore location (save hours of searching)
- **Mining Potions**: Increased mining speed and light
- **Dangersense Potions**: Avoid traps in dangerous areas
- **Hunter Potions**: Find enemies and critters more easily

**Cave Exploration Strategy**:
